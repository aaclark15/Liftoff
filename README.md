# Liftoff
My Liftoff Project is a Home Redecorating Tracker. 

I'm creating a web-app that allows users to track household items along with their budget for a home redecorating project. 
Home projects can be categorized and items can be viewed on a grid format to help the user better visualize items before they purchase.

Used Java, MySQL, Spring, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
